Hey There 🤙🏻,
 
My name is Skylar and I am a software engineer and entreprenur. I am currenlty working full-time at Apple as an iOS engineer. Throughout my time in college I founded two startups, [SYPHER](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sypher-music/id1374755518) and [Loan Link](https://loan-link.webflow.io). I am almost always working on some personal project, some of which make it to the App Store. I am currenlty tinkering with LLMs 🧪 and cookbooks 👨🏼‍🍳

# Projects & Startups
## ReImagine / AI Avatars & Photos
ReImagine is a simple iOS app where users can fine-tune a stable diffusion model on photos of themseleves and use custom prompts. They can also use off the shelf text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion to create AI Photos. I built the finetuning and inferece pipelines on Google Cloud and a hybrid UIKit/SwiftUI iOS client.
